<h1 id="sec-intro">Introduction</h1>
<p>Ever since Ahmet Elmin Alman and Fīlīb dī Ṭarrāzī (Philip de Tarrazi ), who published their works on the eve of World War I, the history of the periodical press in the Ottoman Empire and its Arabic speaking provinces in the Eastern Mediterranean has received continuous scholarly attention.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> For a long time these endeavours have been both encyclopaedic and anecdotal in nature. Compiled by local scholars, many of them themselves journalists, these works adhered to a specific political view of Arab nationalism and regularly neglected references to the object of their study, the periodical press itself, as a source.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> After the publication of a wave of union catalogues of periodicals,<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> individual publishers and periodicals became the subject of critical scholarly scrutiny for the intellectual history of the <em>naḥda</em> and Arabic nationalism in Lebanon and Egypt from the 1970s onwards.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Being mostly concerned with intellectual history, scholars focussed, and still focus for a large part on opinion pieces and editorials published in journals rather than the mundane news press. At the same time, the profane history of the papers themselves was relegated to the margins.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Two noteworthy exceptions to this rule are Donald Cioeta’s work on the history of <em>Thamarāt al-Funūn</em> and censorship in Ottoman Beirut<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and Ami Ayalon’s extensive writings on the press in the Arab Middle East.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Detailed studies on longer—if not entire—periods of individual publication are still lacking beyond Cioeta’s unpublished thesis and Dagmar Glaß’ study on <em>al-Muqtaṭaf</em>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>The time under study is often considered as two distinct periods divided by the Young Turk Revolution of July 1908 and marked by diametrically opposed approaches to liberty and the freedom of speech. Indeed, the number of papers published in Beirut and Damascus during the Hamidian era remained small and highly stable, while after the restoration of the constitution, the number of published titles exploded.{&gt;&gt;Add some numbers&lt;&lt;} To explain these differences in the number and longevity of periodicals, many scholars recount the dominant narrative of Hamidian authoritarian rule versus the liberal government of the Young Turks.<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> As a brain-child of nation building narratives after 1908 and particularly the Turkish and Arabic nationalist movements after World War I, this narrative of authoritarianism versus liberal freedoms should be treated with the necessary caution as to distorting biases. Apart from outright censorship, Ami Ayalon as well as Donald Cioeta point at the importance of limiting factors for the growth of print runs during the Hamidian era: very low literacy rates, prohibitive subscription costs, lack of sufficient infrastructure in the Syrian hinterland to deliver dated news in time, and the lack of interest and incentives to read newspapers.<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Despite much progress in easing the means of transport and communication and spreading formal education, these obstacles remained the most important checks to a modern “public sphere” in either Habermas’ or Anderson’s sense—as constituted in and through reading—well after World War I.</p>
<p>While in July 1908 the Young Turks abolished the regulatory, and even repressive, printing laws<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> and while article 12 of the restored constitution granted freedom of the press,<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> none of the publishers of the numerous new periodicals in Damascus and Beirut failed to obtain the now officially unnecessary permit for publication.<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Within a few months, the new regime began a new crackdown on an increasingly critical press<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> and only one year after the revolution new regulations were promulgated that introduced a much stricter censorship regime than ever before.<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> These new regulations and their actual implementation—especially from 1911/12 onwards—were one of the major reasons for the plethora of short-lived papers. In addition, publishers, authors, and censors throughout the entire period formed a tightly knit network of a very few persons. These men—as for the large part women neither published newspapers nor contributed to their content—were not just well-known to each other and quite often related by marriage. Many, particularly in such a provincial city as Damascus, worked at more than one paper at a time, including the official publications, or held positions in the provincial administration and censorship offices, thus further blurring boundaries of official, semi-official, and private newspapers. Likewise, their audience, as far as it can be established, belonged to the literate male elites, notables, bureaucrats, entrepreneurs, and intellectuals.<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Re-evaluating common periodisations of the history of the periodical press, I argue that, instead of two periods divided by the Young Turk revolution, one encounters an ever-accelerating expansion of the state and its institutions into society from the 1880s onwards with a short interruption of one year, if at all, between July 1908 and July 1909—both in legal theory and the implementation of press laws in the Ottoman <em>Bilād al-Shām</em>. Secondly I argue that a shared belief in the press as inherently modern among authors, readers, and regulators and the mutual dependence of the authorities and the press resulted in implicit censorship through an internalised habitus—a gentlemen’s agreement as to which news were worth reporting on and which were not.</p>
<p>While the large picture of Arabic periodical publication in the Eastern Mediterranean in general and Beirut in particularly is relatively well-known, detailed information is often surprisingly scarce and limited to the intellectual figureheads of their time. This is particularly true for Damascus, with the exception of the figure of Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī, who has received repeated scholarly attention.<a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The main reasons for this lack of comprehensive information on the number of titles, publication dates, their authors, their content, the network of personal relations any “public” discourse took place in, as well as to the machinations of censorship are that many papers were short lived and had only a small print run, that most of them were not collected by institutions at the time of publication, that preserving existing holdings was not the top priority during the numerous and often violent regime changes of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, that collections are dispersed throughout the world, and finally the small number of union catalogues, most of which are more than 20 years old.<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Recent progress in large scale digitization efforts is beginning to bear fruition, although they mostly focus on monthly periodicals and—I am afraid—they will be outpaced by the current destruction of cultural heritage in Syria.<a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>On the following pages, I will provide the legal framework under which periodicals in Beirut and Damascus operated and short publication histories of the periodicals employed for this thesis. I will introduce the reading public and the network of authors, editors, and censors as the writing public of Damascus to whose gaze on local affairs the historian’s scrutiny is limited. Finally, I will turn to the question of censorship.</p>
<h1 id="sec-laws">1.1 Laws and newspapers: the ever expanding modernising state and the question of censorship</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The typical press regime developed in three stages. In the first stage, newspapers were official and editing was the same as censorship. Privately owned, but officially subsidized, newspapers came next. For obvious reasons, these were also self-censored. Finally, when newspapers became financially independent, whether by circulation revenues, private financing, or advertising, their potential power forced the state to decide between reliance on social consensus and enactment of press censorship laws to control the contents of the periodical press. The Ottoman Empire, like most of its contemporary states, chose the latter.<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Accepting this model, I argue that Donald Cioeta was only partially right in his judgement of its application to the Ottoman case, even though, it must be said, he did explicitly reject the idea of perfect censorship and argued that “at its worst it was certainly not the harshest censorship regime in Europe”.<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> This is due to a number of factors. First, Cioeta did not evaluate the increasingly detailed Ottoman legislation beyond the 1864 Law on Printed Material and argued that it was applied until 1908—an assumption that was shared by Ami Ayalon’s later study on “The Press in the Middle East”, who otherwise claimed that a rule of law (albeit restrictive) began only after 1908.<a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Second, Cioeta limited the scope of his study to the reign of ʿAbdülḥamīd II, and could thus not see that the third phase of this model press regime came into full force only after mid-1909. Third, the Ottoman reliance on social consensus among the small elite of journalists-cum-entrepreneurs-cum-officials is difficult to prove beyond insinuations provided by prosopographical data and thematic preferences of the periodicals themselves. Nevertheless, it cannot simply be discarded, especially for the city of the Damascus, whose newspapers before 1908 were either the official gazette or semi-official papers published by leading officials.</p>
<p>During the time under study, newspapers and printed materials were subject to four laws on printing presses, two laws on publications and periodicals, as well as twice to the constitution. As we will see in the course of this chapter, many of the publishers and authors in Beirut and Damascus were trained lawyers, elected members of courts, and generally well-acquainted with a bureaucratic apparatus and its machinations. As such they were not just metaphorical translators of an Ottoman modernity through their command of nascent mass media. They literally translated from Ottoman and French into Arabic (and most likely vice versa) in administrative posts and bi-lingual newspapers.<a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> They wrote Arabic dictionaries<a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> and they produced and distributed the necessary Arabic translations of Ottoman legal texts to the larger—and less polyglot—public.<a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The first argument for the importance and ubiquitous presence of Ottoman legal texts for the history of the press in <em>Bilād al-Shām</em> is thus that publishers invested the time and money to have them promptly translated into Arabic within months, if not only a few weeks.</p>
<p>{&gt;&gt;According to Malik Sharif and a BOA document, Khalīl Khūrī Efendi was officially commissioned to produce Arabic translations of Ottoman laws in March 1872; {Sharif 2014@20}&lt;&lt;}</p>
<h2 id="legal-framework-until-1908-the-modernising-project">1.1.1 Legal framework until 1908: the modernising project</h2>
<h3 id="law-on-printing-presses">1857: Law on Printing Presses</h3>
<p>The first Ottoman Law on Printing Presses (<em>maṭbaʿa niẓāmnāmesi</em>) was promulgated in January 1857.<a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> It specified that Ottoman and foreign subjects henceforth needed to obtain a permit from the Grand Vizierate or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for opening a printing press and for any publication (article 1–6). According to the very short and unspecific article 7, any harmful (<em>muẕarr</em>) publication printed in the Ottoman Empire would be seized and forfeited by the police. Transgressions of this law were to result in the closure of the printing press and legal prosecution (9).</p>
<h3 id="december">1864, 31 December</h3>
<p>Apart from the 1857 regulation, the first Ottoman law specifically dealing with periodical publications{&gt;&gt; Even though the term “maṭbūʿāt” refers to printed material in general, it seems to be limited to periodicals in the Ottoman context.&lt;&lt;} was the Law on Printed Material (<em>maṭbūʿāt niẓāmnāmesi</em>) of 31 December{&gt;&gt; According to {Sharif 2014@15} the law was promulgated on 5 Shaʿ 1281 [4 Jan 1865] and not the second. But dustūr quotes my date.&lt;&lt;} 1864.<a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Its 35 articles specified that Ottoman and foreign males over 30 could apply to the Ministry of Education for a permit to publish a periodical. Publication without prior written permit was prohibited (article 1–3). The authorities were to be supplied with a copy of every issue and every published copy had to carry the imprint of the owner or publisher (4), who, in addition to individual and undersigned authors was made personally accountable for any incriminating passage (7). Every journal had the duty to print without delay and charge both official communications and replies to articles (8).</p>
<p>The law was predominantly concerned with regulating the permissible content of periodicals and with detailing the penalties in cases of transgression against these regulations. In other words, articles 13 to 34 designed the basis for an Ottoman system of censorship. Under the law, it was prohibited to incite the readers to crimes against public order (<em>memālik-i maḥrūseniñ āsāyışi</em>) or the security of the empire (13), to violate public morals (<em>ādāb-ı ʿumūmiye ve meḥāsin-i eḫlāḳ-ı milliye</em>), or to instigate contempt against any recognised religious sect (14). Equally punishable were offences, insults, and baseless allegations against the Sultan, the imperial family, ministers, officials and institutions of the Ottoman Empire and generally any defamation of a second person (15–25). Finally, the reproduction or publication of false news was prohibited (26). In consequence of offences against the Sultan, his family, members of the government, and foreign agents (15–17, 21), papers could be suspended for up to one month (27). Any periodical that received three such convictions within two years could be indefinitely banned from publication (29). A periodical was equally to be suspended from publication, when the owner or editor was imprisoned for offences against this law (30). Periodicals were obliged to print all warnings and suspensions issued to them in the next issue (28).</p>
<p>Yet despite such detailed regulations, the law did not provide prescriptions for an administrative implementation of the surveillance of newspapers beyond the vague formulations of article 4, which mentioned the press directorate in Istanbul and the provincial governors as the responsible authorities. The law did not subject periodicals to official censorship before publication, despite the requirement of supplying these authorities with copies of every issue. Instead, all transgressions, but those under articles 15–17, 19–21, and 24, the prosecution of which was concentrated at the Sublime Porte, had to be taken to the courts by the injured party <em>ex post facto</em>, be they private or representatives of the state (31–34). {&gt;&gt;Thus, contrary to scholarly claims to the contrary, neither preemptive censorship nor the office of a “censor” (<em>murāqib</em>) did officially exist until a much later time.&lt;&lt;}</p>
<h3 id="september-supplement">1875, 10 September: Supplement</h3>
<p>Only a few months prior to the promulgation of the first Ottoman constitution, a supplement to the Law on Printed Material was issued. It limited the permissible content of supplements published by the owners and managers of periodicals to dates, official communications and telegrams. Any transgression as well as any publication of false news, use of strong language or anything that could stir the minds of the people (<em>teḫdīş-i eẕhān</em>{&gt;&gt; <em>takhdīsh al-adhhān</em>&lt;&lt;}) was to be punished with a suspension of one to three months.<a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> This latter phrase of <em>teḫdīş-i eẕhān</em> became prominent in the censors’ warnings in Beirut.</p>
<h3 id="december-the-first-ottoman-constitution">1876, 23 December: the first Ottoman constitution</h3>
<p>The first Ottoman constitution (<em>ḳānūn-i esāsi</em>, <em>düstūr</em>) was promulgated on 23 December 1876 and published in Ottoman as well as an official French translation.<a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Drawing upon these two “originals”, two independent Arabic translations were published in Beirut by <em>al-Jinān</em> and <em>Thamarāt al-Funūn</em> within only four weeks.<a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Article 12 specified that “the press is free within the boundaries of the law” (<em>maṭbūʿāt ḳānūn dāʿiresinde serbesttir</em>).<a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The meaning of such phrase and the extent of liberty is far from clear, when one considers that the 1864 Law on Printed Material was not abrogated until 1894.<a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> In the course of the Ottoman-Russian War (1877–78), the Ottoman Empire tried to limit the distribution of hostile propaganda through bans on imports of various newspapers and the publication of information on Ottoman casualties and military operations.<a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> After parliament had been dissolved on 14 February 1878, the constitution was formally abolished on 11 December 1879.<a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="november">1894, 20 November</h3>
<p>A new Law on Printing Presses (<em>maṭbaʿalar niẓāmnāmesi</em>) was promulgated on 22 January 1888. But apart from it being mentioned as abrogated by its successor, I could not locate any copy of its text.{&gt;&gt; {Boyar 2006@422} references a source: Düstur, Birinci Tertib. Vol. V (Ankara: Bascvekalet MatbaasI, 1937), 992-1000.&lt;&lt;} The latter law was promulgated on 20 November 1894 and abrogated both laws on printing presses of 1857 and 1888. Arabic translations were printed by <em>al-Bashīr</em> and <em>Thamarāt al-Funūn</em> within six weeks of the law’s promulgation.<a href="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Despite its name, the law was not only concerned with regulating and surveillance of the printing process, but also the published content</p>
<p>The law further regulated the issuing of permits, which now required detailed information on name, personal history, and addresses to be supplied to the Ministry of the Interior or the governors and the police in order to check the criminal record of the applicant and his ancestors. The permit had then to be produced to the police and the Directorate of Public Instruction (<em>mudīriye-i maʿārif</em>) for continued supervision of publications (articles 1–7). Publishers were obliged to include a full imprint in every copy printed (12). Finally, all producers of type-faces and matrices had to hold a permit to exercise their trade (13) as had any trader and distributor of printed materials (29–30) as well as the posters{&gt;&gt; Plakatierer&lt;&lt;} of announcements (35).</p>
<p>The law did not stop at regulating the trades and workers, but aimed at the surveillance of the workshops: printing presses had to be designated in Ottoman writing above their entrance, they were not allowed to posses any secondary exits into neighbouring buildings, and during printing the doors of the workshop had to be unlocked (14) in order to facilitate unannounced inspections by the inspectors of the educational council (15). Any bookstore, warehouse, or library could be searched for prohibited materials by the director of education (28) and to ease identification of transgressors, presses had to provide samples of every available type to the authorities (17).</p>
<p>After having established a bureaucratic system of surveillance, the law set upon regulating permissible content. Apart from commercial and personal announcements (24), any publication or imports thereof needed prior written authorisation from the Ministry of Education (and the religious authorities if necessary) (20–23, 26–27). Printers were personally responsible to supply the names of authors of unauthorised publications (18). Those openly or secretly transporting, selling or distributing printed material violating public morals or prohibited material were to be considered and prosecuted as accomplices of the original authors (32). The following types of publications were to be seized and forfeited (27, 30):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>printed religious or political pamphlets or libels, inciting hostility towards the holy personality of the Sultan, his imperial government, the institutions of the empire, and the officially recognised religious sects;</li>
<li>printed material containing any incitement to crimes;</li>
<li>designs and engravings violating good morals and indecent pictures;</li>
<li>material whose import into the empire had been previously prohibited by public announcement.</li>
</ol>
<p>The law further attempted to control the distribution of printed material. It prohibited to distribute or post any but commercial and personal announcements in streets and public roads, without previously obtaining an authorization from the municipalities. Announcements for theatrical performances and similar entertainment had to be abridged in Ottoman if they were written in local vernaculars or foreign languages (33–34). Finally, any distributor of periodical publications was not allowed to shout out anything but the title of the paper on streets and public places (<em>maḥallāt ʿumūmiyya</em>) (31).</p>
<p>To enforce the regulations, the law devised financial penalties, confiscations, and suspensions in addition to penalties for felonies under the penal code (40–45, 47). Most offences were subject to a three-strikes-and-you-are-out rule. Unlike earlier laws, the judiciary and law enforcement agencies were now tasked with the enforcement of these rules. With this law, the Ottoman Empire formulated its normative claim to absolute authority over the publication and dissemination of printed texts.</p>
<h3 id="december-1">1901, December</h3>
<p>In early December 1901, <em>Lisān al-Ḥāl</em> published a reprint from <em>al-Shām</em> in Damascus, announcing that the Ministry of the Interior issued orders to re-organize and centralize the censorship of newspapers (<em>murāqabat al-jarāʾid</em>)<a href="#fn36" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> within a single administration under the responsibility of the respective directorates of printing (<em>mudīriyyat al-maṭbūʿāt</em>{&gt;&gt; again the local administration did not know such an office&lt;&lt;}). The accompanying <em>tezkere</em> explicitly subjected all branches of the imperial administration and their official publications to the regime of censorship.<a href="#fn37" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="periodicals-prior-to-1908">1.1.2 Periodicals prior to 1908</h2>
<p>{&gt;&gt;This needs a better introduction and the previous section needs some short summary</p>
<p>The sub-chapter covers only the newspapers employed for this thesis. It is structured into four parts: official newspapers, the private press of Beirut, the semi-private press of Damascus, and permits without subsequent publication of newspapers&lt;&lt;}</p>
<h3 id="official-newspapers">Official newspapers</h3>
<h4 id="ḥadīqat-al-akhbār">1858, <em>Ḥadīqat al-Akhbār</em></h4>
<p><em>Ḥadīqat al-Akhbār</em> (The Garden of News, 1858–1911) was the first newspaper published in <em>Bilād al-Shām</em> and the first newspaper to be published in Arabic outside the empire’s capital.<a href="#fn38" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Until his death in 1907, Khalīl Efendi al-Khūrī was <em>Ḥadīqat al-Akhbār</em>’s publisher and editor. In the aftermath of the civil strife in 1860, <em>Ḥadīqat al-Akhbār</em> became the semi-official paper of the province and shifted from weekly to bi-weekly publication in the early 1860s.<a href="#fn39" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> After the establishment of the vilayet (province) of Syria in 1865 and the publication of an official gazette under the title <em>Sūriye</em> in Damascus, <em>Ḥadīqat al-Akhbār</em> lost its status as a quasi-official publication. But three years later, it eventually became the official gazette of the province of Lebanon under Frankū (Franco) Pasha and commenced publishing a French speaking section, thereby cutting its four Arabic pages to two.<a href="#fn40" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> During the 1880s, the period for which I have seen copies, it had returned to the weekly publication cycle and it was sold in Damascus by the provincial printing press.<a href="#fn41" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> In 1892, its 35th year of publication, the paper was edited by Wadīʿ Efendi al-Khūrī, a relative of Khalīl Efendi al-Khūrī<a href="#fn42" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a>, who became the paper’s concessionary after the latter’s death in 1907.<a href="#fn43" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>Currently there are only two known partial collections of <em>Ḥadīqat al-Akhbār</em>: The first collection, containing the first 10 years from 1858–68 is available at various institutions worldwide. In consequence, this series has been the source and focus for many scholarly works.<a href="#fn44" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The second surviving collection of the years 1881–88 is available at the American University Beirut only and has not yet been employed by scholars.<a href="#fn45" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> It is this second collection, which was employed for this thesis.</p>
<h4 id="sūriye">1865, <em>Sūriye</em></h4>
<p><em>Sūriye</em> was the official gazette of the province of Syria and the first paper to be published in Damascus. It commenced publication on 19 November 1865.<a href="#fn46" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Published every Thursday, it contained two pages each in Arabic and Ottoman Turkish with similar content. From some secondary sources, the <em>Sālnāme</em>s, and the pages of <em>Sūriye</em> itself, it appears that the Arabic part was more or less a direct translation of the Turkish section.<a href="#fn47" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Judged from the pagination the language of the front page changed at irregular intervals.</p>
<p><em>Sūriye</em> was printed at the provincial printing press, which was housed in or next to the Old Serail at Marja Square,<a href="#fn48" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> and its responsible publishers were the respective directors of the provincial printing press and its movable-type section:<a href="#fn49" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Salīm Ayūb Efendi (1877),<a href="#fn50" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Khalīl Efendi al-Khūrī (1877–86)<a href="#fn51" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a>, and Muṣṭafā Wāṣif Efendi (1886–1908)<a href="#fn52" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a>. The <em>Sālnāme</em>s provide detailed lists of names for the staff of the provincial printing press, sometimes explicitly naming those responsible for publishing and printing the official gazette and its translators. Among them were the editors Rāfit Bey,<a href="#fn53" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> [Aḥmad] ʿIzzet Bey [al-ʿĀbid] (Arabic section),<a href="#fn54" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> ʿĀrifī Bey (Turkish section)<a href="#fn55" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a>, Khalīl Efendi [al-Khūrī] (Turkish section),<a href="#fn56" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Edhem Efendi,<a href="#fn57" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> ʿAlī Riḍā Efendi,<a href="#fn58" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Jamāl Bey,<a href="#fn59" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Yaʿqūb Efendi,<a href="#fn60" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> and Tawfīq Efendi,<a href="#fn61" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> the copy-editors Shaykh Sulaymān Efendi<a href="#fn62" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> and Walā al-Dīn Efendi,<a href="#fn63" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> and the Arabic translators Ḥanā Nawfal Efendi<a href="#fn64" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a>, Maḥmūd Efendi<a href="#fn65" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a>, Jibrān Efendi [Louis]<a href="#fn66" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a>, Amīn Efendi<a href="#fn67" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a>, Ismāʿīl Efendi<a href="#fn68" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a>, and Adīb Naẓmī Efendi.<a href="#fn69" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> This list of names is insofar significant, as some of the editors were important contributors to and publishers of other newspapers and high-ranking persona. This is especially true for Aḥmad ʿIzzat Bey (later Pasha) al-ʿĀbid, who became the second secretary to the Sultan. Being part of core modernising technologies, printing—and particularly lithography—was also taught at the industrial orphanage (<em>iṣlāḥḫāne</em>). Hence, students as well as graduates of the <em>islāḥḫāne</em> were regularly recorded among the staff of the printing press.<a href="#fn70" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>Three partial collections of longer periods of publication are known: Most of the issues between No. 1–476 at the Millet Kütüphanesi in Istanbul,<a href="#fn71" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> No. 867–1147 (1882–88) at the American University Beirut, and No. 1701–1866 (1899–1902) at the Bayezit Devlet Kütüphanesi in Istanbul. The present study employs the latter two collections. Together with <em>al-Shām</em>, <em>Sūriye</em> was the main source of reprints and news articles in the Beiruti press.<a href="#fn72" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="the-private-press-of-beirut">The private press of Beirut</h3>
<h4 id="al-bashīr">1870, <em>al-Bashīr</em></h4>
<p><em>Al-Bashīr</em> (The Herald) was a weekly Arabic-speaking newspaper of four pages published every Friday by the Jesuits in Beirut between 1870 and 1947. Apart from foreign news, the paper displayed a clear preference for news of importance to a Catholic community and religious commentaries. Nevertheless, it was far from an apolitical special-interest publication, had regular quarrels with other newspapers both in Beirut and Cairo, and received repeated warnings from the censor in the 1880s and 1890s.<a href="#fn73" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>The Jesuit father Mikhāʾīl Fākiyānī was <em>al-Bashīr</em>’s agent in Damascus and a rather active correspondent from that town between 1878 and 1880.<a href="#fn74" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> After the early 1880s, <em>al-Bashīr</em>’s community of readers-cum-correspondents reporting from Damascus was much smaller and less active than those of <em>Lisān al-Ḥāl</em> or <em>Thamarāt al-Funūn</em>. Instead, <em>al-Bashīr</em> resorted to reprints from Damascene papers. Among my sample, <em>al-Bashīr</em> accounts for more than half of all reprints from Damascene papers with about three fourths of these articles being clippings from the official gazette <em>Sūriye</em>.</p>
<p>Complete collections of <em>al-Bashīr</em> are available at the American University Beirut and Université Saint-Joseph de Beyrouth, from which I employed the years 1878–82 and 1887–1910. {&gt;&gt;The gap between 1882 and 1887 is caused by the availability of both <em>Ḥadīqat al-Akhbār </em>and <em>Sūriye</em>, to whom I resorted&lt;&lt;}</p>
<h4 id="al-janna">1870, <em>al-Janna</em></h4>
<p>Salīm al-Bustānī, son of Buṭrus al-Bustānī, the publisher of the fortnightly <em>al-Jinān</em>, published <em>al-Janna</em> (The Paradise),<a href="#fn75" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> a bi-weekly Arabic-speaking newspaper in Beirut every Tuesday and Friday<a href="#fn76" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> since 11 June 1870.<a href="#fn77" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Between 1871 and 1875, the Bustānīs published an additional newspaper, <em>al-Junayna</em> (The Garden), four times a week. In combination with <em>al-Janna</em>, they were the first to provide daily coverage of events in Beirut.<a href="#fn78" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> In December 1881, <em>al-Janna</em> and <em>al-Jinān</em> joined forces as the junior partners of Khalīl Efendi Sarkīs’ <em>Lisān al-Ḥāl</em>, on whose printing press they were henceforth printed.<a href="#fn79" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> After Salīm al-Bustānī’s death in September 1884,<a href="#fn80" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> the concession was renewed by his brother, Najīb al-Bustānī,<a href="#fn81" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> but publication was finally suspended by the authorities for an article in No. 1508 of 29 September 1885.<a href="#fn82" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> {&gt;&gt;The footnote should be moved to the body&lt;&lt;}The <em>Sālnāme</em>s for 1302 and 1303M, published in 1886 and 1887, still listed <em>al-Janna</em> as being published by Najīb al-Bustānī in Beirut, but as they omited <em>al-Bashīr</em> even though copies of the latter paper survive till this very day, this statement should be treated cautiously.<a href="#fn83" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Even more so, as <em>al-Janna</em> was never mentioned again by other newspapers and as Najīb al-Bustānī commenced working for the administration of public instruction and moved to Cairo in 1886.<a href="#fn84" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p>In Damascus, <em>al-Jinān</em>—and most likely also its sibling <em>al-Janna</em>—was distributed via Mikhāʾīl Efendi al-Qassāṭlī, brother of Nuʿmān Efendi al-Qassāṭlī, author of the famous book “<em>al-rawḍa al-ghannāʾ fī dimashq al-fayḥāʾ</em>”, in 1878.<a href="#fn85" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a>{&gt;&gt; check later copies from Princeton&lt;&lt;}</p>
<p>Today exist two partial collections running from 1870–74 and from 1879–84.<a href="#fn86" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> From the latter, I read volumes twelve and thirteen running from 1883 to 1884.</p>
<h4 id="thamarāt-al-funūn">1875, <em>Thamarāt al-Funūn</em></h4>
<p><em>Thamarāt al-Funūn</em> (The Fruits of Knowledge, 1875–1908)<a href="#fn87" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> was the first Muslim newspaper of Beirut, established by the benevolent society <em>Jamʿiyyat al-Funūn</em> in 1875 under the editorship of ʿAbd al-Qādir al-Qabbānī, who soon became the sole owner and editor of the paper.<a href="#fn88" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Being an ardent Ottomanist and reformer, al-Qabbānī only rarely came into conflict with censorship. The general support for the Ottoman Empire was mirrored by the incorporation of the Ottoman crescent and star in the newspaper’s masthead—unlike other newspapers, <em>Thamarāt al-Funūn</em> did not abolish this symbolic address{&gt;&gt; wording?&lt;&lt;} of loyalty until the end of publication.<a href="#fn89" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> With the appointment of al-Qabbānī as president of the Beirut municipality and later as member of the city’s <em>bidāya</em> court, Aḥmad Ḥasan Ṭabbāra took over as editor with the beginning of the newspaper’s twenty-fifth year of publication in 1898 until he established his own daily newspaper <em>al-Ittiḥād al-ʿUthmānī</em> soon after the Young Turk Revolution of July 1908.<a href="#fn90" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Only a few months later, on 1 November, al-Qabbānī announced the end of <em>Thamarāt al-Funūn</em> arguing that enough independent newspapers were available to the readers.<a href="#fn91" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Apart from four months between August and December 1878, during which it shifted to biweekly publication,<a href="#fn92" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> <em>Thamarāt al-Funūn</em> was a weekly newspaper, published every Monday. The originally four pages increased to eight with the beginning of the twenty-fifth year of publication in 1898.<a href="#fn93" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<p>{&gt;&gt;Wtf? Why didn’t I check the publication frequency myself? Between August and December 1878 <em>Thamarāt al-Funūn</em> shifted to biweekly publication on Mondays and Thursdays, but with issue #209, al-Qabbānī reverted back to the weekly publication schedule on 30 December 1878.{thamarat 209a; thamarat 210; thamarat 211; thamarat 212a; thamrat 213a}.&lt;&lt;} {&gt;&gt;Thamarāt al-Funūn moved to new premises and a new press in April 1901, causing a week-long gap in publication; {tf-oib 1327@5} &lt;&lt;}</p>
<p>Adīb Efendi Naẓmī, the later publisher of <em>al-Shām</em> and editor of the Arabic section of <em>Sūriye</em>, was <em>Thamarāt al-Funūn</em>’s correspondent in Damascus in the 1880s.<a href="#fn94" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> In 1904, Shukrī al-ʿAsalī, who was elected to the Ottoman parliament as deputy for Damascus in 1911<a href="#fn95" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> and who was executed on Marja Square in 1916, <a href="#fn96" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> was mentioned as <em>Thamarāt al-Funūn</em>’s new agent in Damascus.<a href="#fn97" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<p>Complete collections are available at various libraries.<a href="#fn98" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> As the news from Damascus became less frequent and the editorial focus of the paper shifted in the late 1890s, I employed the years 1875–1895 and 1908 for this study.</p>
<h4 id="lisān-al-ḥāl">1877, <em>Lisān al-Ḥāl</em></h4>
<p>The bi-weekly Arabic-speaking newspaper <em>Lisān al-Ḥāl</em> (Voice of the Present)<a href="#fn99" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> was one of the latest of the long-running periodicals to be published in Beirut. Publication began every Monday and Thursday in October 1877 under the editorship of Khalīl Sarkīs{&gt;&gt;, whom di Ṭarrāzī calls <em>shaykh al-ṣaḥāfiyyīn</em>,&lt;&lt;}. After the end of <em>al-Junayna</em> in 1875, <em>Lisān al-Ḥāl</em> became the only Beiruti paper dedicating a whole page to viable information on trade and commerce{&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;}{&gt;&gt;in every issue&lt;&lt;}. From 16 June 1894 (no. 1622) onwards the paper was published daily from Monday to Saturday, with the Monday edition assuming the role of a weekly digest of note-worthy articles and events.<a href="#fn100" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
<p>{&gt;&gt;Unlike other newspapers, <em>Lisān al-Ḥāl</em> was a most successful economic endeavour&lt;&lt;}</p>
<p>At the current moment, the only subscriber from Damascus known by his full name was Asʿad Efendi al-Shiqlī in 1908.<a href="#fn101" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> The famous lawyer Jibrān Efendi Louis was <em>Lisān al-Ḥāl</em>’s correspondent in Damascus during the early years of publication<a href="#fn102" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> and between 1887 and 1891, an otherwise unknown ʿAbdallah Jabūr, signed 16 long articles from Damascus in the correspondence (<em>murāsalāt</em>) section of <em>Lisān al-Ḥāl</em> with his initials “ʿ.J.”. In these articles, he voiced a fervent patriotism, calling for the unity of the nation, the people, and the state in pushing reforms, such as improving the general means of transport in the province and improving public health through cleaning, paving, and knowledge etc. From an article of July 1890 it becomes clear that he had access to and good knowledge of recent numbers of <em>al-Muqtaṭaf</em> (Cairo).<a href="#fn103" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> On the occasion of laying the foundation stone for the Hawran railway on 9 March 1891, he delivered one of the festive speeches.<a href="#fn104" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> Finally, Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī signed some of <em>Lisān al-Ḥāl’s</em> news reports from Damascus during the summer of 1894.<a href="#fn105" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>
<p>The authorities in Beirut and Damascus issued about 20 warnings and suspensions to <em>Lisān al-Ḥāl</em> during the period under study. At least on three occasions during the 1880s and one in 1903 the suspensions were actually enforced.<a href="#fn106" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>
<p>An almost complete collection is available at American University Beirut,<a href="#fn107" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> from which I employed the years 1877–1914. As reports from Damascus did not increase with the number of weekly pages after <em>Lisān al-Ḥāl</em> became a daily newspaper, I resorted to the weekly summaries and reprints of important articles in the Monday issue, but returned to the daily issues for the coverage of events established through other sources.</p>

<h4 id="al-shām">1896, <em>al-Shām</em></h4>
<p>The third and last newspaper to be published in Damascus during the Hamidian era was <em>al-Shām</em>. According to a file at the Başbakanlık Osmanlı Arşivi, the original permit to publish a weekly and bi-lingual Arabic and Ottoman newspaper in Damascus was granted to Amīn Efendi Tarakci in July 1879.<a href="#fn120" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> However, no further references to such a title can be found until November 1891, when Muṣṭafā Wāṣif Efendi, the director of the provincial printing press, applied for a concession to publish a bi-lingual political newspaper thrice a week.<a href="#fn121" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> A permit for weekly publication was granted within the legally prescribed period of a month<a href="#fn122" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> and the newspaper <em>al-Shām</em> under the editorship of Muṣṭafā Wāṣif Efendi’s brother-in-law Adīb Naẓmī Efendi was announced in the Beiruti press in June 1892.<a href="#fn123" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> However, the first issue was only published four years later on Tuesday, 10 Ṣafār 1296 aH (21 July 1896).<a href="#fn124" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a></p>
<p>The now exclusively Arabic-speaking paper was immediately picked up as a source of information from Damascus.<a href="#fn125" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> Within a year its articles provoked considerable stress among foreign consular staff, as Adīb Naẓmī apparently called on the readers not to trust any foreign power and to oust any official with links to these powers from the administration of the empire.<a href="#fn126" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> From 1897 until 1900, a young Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī, the later publisher of <em>al-Muqtabas</em>, learned the journalistic trade as <em>al-Shām</em>’s editor-in-chief.<a href="#fn127" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> As a semi-official paper,<a href="#fn128" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> publication stopped soon after the restoration of the constitution in 1908.<a href="#fn129" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>

<p>The files at the Başbakanlık Osmanlı Arşivi mention further and sometimes successful applications for permits. None however resulted in any further{&gt;&gt; wording&lt;&lt;} publication of a newspaper until 1908. Adīb Naẓmī applied to open a printing press and to publish a newspaper under the title of <em>al-Ṣabāḥ</em> (The Morning) in Damascus in 1888, but the fate of the application remains unknown.<a href="#fn133" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> Eleven years later Muṣṭafā Wāṣif Efendi, director of the provincial printing press and publisher of the Arabic-speaking newspaper <em>al-Shām</em> obtained the permit to publish an Ottoman-speaking newspaper under the title of <em>Ḥawādis̱-i Müḳtebese</em> (Learned News).<a href="#fn134" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> In 1906, Yasīn Ḥilmī Taqī al-Dīn and Muṣṭafā Shūrā Efendi, a former lithographer at the provincial press and owner of the private printing press <em>al-Fayḥāʾ</em> (The Fragrant, i.e. Damascus) in Bāb al-Barīd<a href="#fn135" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a>, applied for the permit to publish a weekly newspaper of the same name.<a href="#fn136" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a></p>
<p>Particularly twisted is the story of Khalīl Efendi al-Qārslī, who, over the course of some twenty years applied and tried to publish variously titled periodicals in Damascus. In 1889, we find Khalīl Efendi al-Qārslī’s first application for a permit to open a printing press and publish a newspaper in Damascus, the never-published <em>Kawākab al-Sharq</em> (The Eastern Star).<a href="#fn137" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> The next year, <em>Sūriye</em> reported that Khālid [sic] Efendi al-Qārslī,<a href="#fn138" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> obtained the concession to run a printing press and publish an Ottoman and Arabic-speaking newspaper under the title of <em>Rawḍat al-Shām</em> (The Gardens of Damascus).<a href="#fn139" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> However, the matter is only mentioned again in a file from the Defter-i Ḫāḳānī in Istanbul dating to 1892 stating that Khālid Efendi, whose original application had been rejected, petitioned the authorities to re-open the application process and to grant a permit.<a href="#fn140" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> Again the issues vanishes from the sources until 1897, when the provincial <em>Sālnāme</em>s began listing Khālid Efendi Qārslī’s printing press of <em>Rawḍat al-Shām</em> in Khān Sulṭan Street in the quarter of Qanawāt, as the first private printing press in Damascus established in 1309 R (1893/4).<a href="#fn141" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> However, the biweekly newspaper <em>Rawḍat al-Shām</em> was finally published by Khālid Efendi Qārslī only after the Young Turk Revolution; in December 1908.<a href="#fn142" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> Again, no surviving collection is known.</p>

<p>One week after the coup d’état in Istanbul that became to be known as the Young Turk Revolution on 23 July 1908 and the restoration of the 1876 constitution a telegraphic order from the Ministry of Post and Telegraph Communications lifted all restrictions on the freedom of press in accordance with {&gt;&gt;article 12 of&lt;&lt;} the constitution.<a href="#fn143" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> The accompanying imperial decree (<em>ḫaṭṭ-ı hümāyūn</em>), whose Arabic translation was printed in mid-August by various Beiruti papers, declared in its paragraph 7 that newspapers needed no permit for being published, that individual issues had not to be approved in advance, and that no letters or any postage were to be subjected to censorship by the post and telegraph officials.<a href="#fn144" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> This went much beyond article 12 of the constitution, which had only stated that “the press is free within the limits of the law”.<a href="#fn145" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a></p>
<p>However, various aspiring publishers and editors in Damascus took no chances and (successfully) applied for permits—even after the full details of the new freedom of press became known: ʿAbd al-Qādir Badrān Efendi{&gt;&gt; Who?

<p>Only three of these papers and Khālid Efendi Qārslī’s <em>Rawḍat al-Shām</em> were actually published before parliament passed a set of laws and regulations that reinstated a much enhanced system of censorship in spring and summer 1909: <em>al-ʿAṣr al-Jadīd</em>, <em>al-Muqtabas</em>, and <em>Dimashq</em>. Copies of all but <em>al-Muqtabas</em> seem not to have survived. <em>Al-ʿAṣr al-Jadīd</em> was the first newspaper to be established after the Young Turk Revolution and the first private newspaper ever published in Damascus. The permit to publish an Arabic weekly had been granted to Nāṣīf Bey Abū Zayd<a href="#fn154" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> in September 1908 and by December 1909, the paper had switched to daily publication.<a href="#fn155" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> Beiruti papers referred to <em>al-ʿAṣr al-Jadīd</em> for their reports on Damascene affairs at least until January 1911.<a href="#fn156" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> Similar to Nāṣīf Bey Abū Zayd, Muḥammad Khayrī Efendi Shabīb obtained the permit to publish a new newspaper under the title <em>Dimashq</em> in September 1908, but the first issue of the then fourth private newspaper was only published on 20 February 1909 by Salīm Efendi Hashīm, Ṭawfīq Efendi Ḥilmī, and Muslim Efendi ʿĀbidīn.<a href="#fn157" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a></p>

<p>Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī, who returned to Damascus from Cairo, where he had published the monthly <em>al-Muqtabas</em>, soon after the Young Turk Revolution, obtained the permit to open a printing press and to publish Damascus’ first daily newspaper under the title of <em>al-Muqtabas</em> in November 1908.<a href="#fn158" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> He published the first issue one month later, on 17 December 1908.<a href="#fn159" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> According to Ami Ayalon, Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī financed the ambitious endeavour from private wealth “and possibly with secret aid from the French consulate as well”.<a href="#fn160" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> The offices and the printing press were originally located in Khān Murādiyya in the quarter of Bāb al-Barīd.<a href="#fn161" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> {&gt;&gt;check Weber 2009a’s wrong localisation of the offices&lt;&lt;} From March 1909 onwards, the address of <em>al-Muqtabas</em>‘offices was listed as being “opposite the government Serail” and later “opposite the municipality”, which meant on the northern banks of the Barada between Marja Square and Grand Hotel Victoria.<a href="#fn162" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> It shared a building with the Café <em>al-Inshirāḥ</em>, whose summer garden happened to be located under the windows of <em>al-Muqtabas</em>’ office.<a href="#fn163" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> In 1912, the newspaper was printed at the “Progress Press” (*matbaʿat al-taraqqī) in the quarter of al-Qaymariyya.<a href="#fn164" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="march-april">1909, March/ April</h3>
<p>As early as March 1909, the authorities began to curtail the newly granted freedom of speech and exploding number of periodicals published in all parts of the empire. The Ministry of Justice reminded the public prosecutor of Syria in early April that in negotiations with the president of the parliament a <em>tezkere</em> was issued, stating that, as long as a new press law was not decided upon by the Senate, the terms of the old one applied to periodicals spreading discord among the different parts and communities (<em>ʿanāṣir</em>) of the empire: They were to be banned from publication.<a href="#fn166" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a></p>
<p>Accordingly, the permit for Ḥabīb Barhūm{&gt;&gt; [sic]&lt;&lt;} Efendi’s bi-lingual newspaper <em>al-Sharq</em> (The East) to be printed at his <em>al-Ṣalāḥ</em> / <em>al-Iṣlāḥ</em><a href="#fn167" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> (Reform) printing press in Damascus, dated to mid-May 1909, already mentions that he had supplied all the required information.<a href="#fn168" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> Until new laws on printing presses and periodicals were promulgated in late July 1909, two further permits were granted to Shaykh ʿAbd al-Qādir Khatīb{&gt;&gt; Who?

<p>As soon as news of a new press law being under negotiation by the legislators spread, periodicals and their editors throughout the empire as well as some members of the parliament heavily criticised the drafts as a re-introduction of repressive censorship and even tighter control than during late Hamidian times. In the course of the negotiations early drafts were leaked and published by newspapers in Istanbul and in Arabic translation by <em>Lisān al-Ḥāl</em><a href="#fn171" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a>—a practice that was to be prohibited by the very draft. Beiruti newspapers critically commented the drive towards renewed surveillance of the press and the empire-wide protest against it from February 1909 onwards.<a href="#fn172" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> In reaction to a large demonstration in Istanbul’s Sultan Ahmet district, the publishers in Beirut were convened by Khalīl Sarkīs and met at the offices of <em>Lisān al-Ḥāl</em> to organise resistance against the new law. They draw up a petition to be forwarded to parliament and eight papers in the capital.<a href="#fn173" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> During the following months, <em>Lisān al-Ḥāl</em> was particularly vocal in its advocacy for absolute independence of the press,<a href="#fn174" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> claiming that prior to the restoration of the constitution the press laws were just and fair, whereas now dictatorial rules had been introduced.<a href="#fn175" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> In consequence, it was the first paper to be prosecuted under the new law, promulgated exactly one year after the Young Turk coup d’état, on 29 July 1909.</p>
<h3 id="july">1909, 29 July</h3>
<p>On 29 July 1909, two new laws were enacted to regulate printing presses as well as periodicals. <em>Lisān al-Ḥāl</em> and <em>al-Bashīr</em> published Arabic translations within two weeks.<a href="#fn176" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a> The new Law on Printing Presses (<em>maṭbaʿalar ḳānūnu</em>) re-introduced the necessity of permits for operating a printing press.<a href="#fn177" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> Full personal details had to be supplied to the Ministry of the Interior or the local authorities (1–3). Currently operating presses had to do so within a month (12). Any printed material had to be approved by the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Education or their local representatives (4). Publications touching on religious issues had to be approved by the respective religious authorities in Istanbul (4, 6). The law was to be enforced and applied by the penal courts and the gendarmerie (8–10). In contrast to earlier laws, foreign subjects would have to accept Ottoman jurisdiction without reference to the consuls (closing clause).</p>
<p>The new Law on Printed Material (<em>maṭbūʿāt ḳānūnu</em>) abrogated the law of 1864 and put renewed emphasis on regulating the permissible content of publications.<a href="#fn178" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a> It pertained to daily newspapers, periodicals, and articles, printed or handwritten leaflets (<em>awrāq</em>) sold or distributed in public places (<em>maḥallāt ʿumūmiyya</em>), places of congregation (<em>amākin al-ijtimāʿ</em>), as well as schedules and announcement on public display (<em>taʿruḍ ʿalā inẓār al-ʿumūm</em>) (24). In addition, the group of persons to be held legally accountable for any offences was much enlarged to include “responsible editors” and directors, authors of articles and those signing them, printers, and the vendors and sellers of incriminating material (11). Present publishers were given one month to comply with this law (final clause).</p>
<p>The law commenced with reiterating the necessity for permits, the basic qualifications of applicants{&gt;&gt; (male, older than 21, free of criminal record, and being literate in the language of publication)&lt;&lt;}, and the information required for granting the permit. Full personal details of all persons involved as well as a detailed record of the printing press and the projected periodical had to be supplied to the Ministry of the Interior, the province and the mutaṣarriflik (1–4). Any change to this information had to be announced to the authorities and could be subjected to a new permit application (5, 7).</p>
<p>To ease surveillance and the prosecution of offenders, titles and names of journals were to be unique until 15 years after the end of publication (6) and the name of the responsible director had to be printed in the header of the newspaper (9).</p>
<p>Concerning the regime of censorship, the law stipulated that two copies of every issue had to be supplied to the highest ranking official of the Ministry of the Interior and the public prosecutor on the day of printing and on the expense of the newspaper (8). Even though newspapers were granted the right to publish minutes of any council meeting or trial, these could be declared secret (13) or as harming public morals (<em>adāb ʿumūmiyya</em>) and thus banned from publication (14). Drafts of laws were banned from publication (15) as were any articles touching on the works (<em>asghāl</em>) of the official recognised sects (<em>diyānāt</em>) or the peoples (<em>ʿanāṣir</em>) of the Sultanate (16). The law further prohibited any incitement to crimes (17), blackmailing (18), the publication of false news, and generally anything potentially disturbing public order (<em>rāḥat ʿumūmiyya</em>) (19) or harming public morals (<em>adāb ʿumūmiyya</em>) (20). Finally, during times of war the publication of any news on troops and defences was prohibited (36). The law also reiterated the stipulations that limited the announcements of vendors selling newspapers in <em>sūq</em>s or public places (<em>maḥallāt ʿumūmiyya</em>) to the name of the periodical and the publisher (10).</p>
<p>A large section is then concerned with detailing the bans on vituperations and insults according to the social rank of the victim (25–30). Any person, who deemed himself morally or materially hurt by an article, had the right to press charges against the responsible director. Verdicts, including material reparations and prison sentences, had then to be printed by the offending paper (12). Similarly, periodicals had the duty to publish official denials and replies from offended persons (21). As in earlier cases, the law prescribed increasing sanctions for repeated offences (22) and granted the authorities extra-judicial measures against a periodical under particular circumstances, such as the incitement to crimes (23).</p>
<p>{&gt;&gt;Rule of law: any violations must be prosecuted within three months of publication otherwise the charges are void (32).&lt;&lt;}</p>
<h3 id="august-amending-article-12-of-the-constitution">1909, 21 August: amending article 12 of the constitution</h3>
<p>The finale gloss to this re-tightening of control over the production, content, and distribution of mass media was provided by an amendment to article 12 of the constitution granting the freedom of press through a majority of two thirds of the senators on 21 August. It stated that the press cannot in any way be subject to supervision or control before [sic] printing.<a href="#fn179" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> This is only a prima facie contradiction to the press law of July 1909, as, although the latter made the prescription that two copies of every issue had to be supplied to the authorities at the date of publication, no article had to be approved by the censor <em>before</em> going into print.</p>
<h3 id="protest-and-renewed-censorship">Protest and renewed censorship</h3>
<p>The newspapers of Beirut and Damascus only sporadically commented on the modification of the press laws during the rest of 1909,<a href="#fn180" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a> even though they rallied in writing and action against the renewed vigour of the authorities in prosecuting diverting opinion through raids of offices, suspensions, and trials.<a href="#fn181" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> Being of the conviction that losing a battle does not mean losing a war, <em>Lisān al-Ḥāl</em> continued its campaign against the law and introduced a new sub-section to the local news page in September 1909. Under the heading of <em>qaḍiyyat al-ṣiḥāfa</em> it pledged to report all hostilities committed by the authorities against journalists and the press until their demands were met and the law was abolished.<a href="#fn182" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a> One day later, it could report that its offices had been illegally raided by municipal guards.<a href="#fn183" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a> Other newspapers and particularly <em>al-Muqtabas</em> condemned the attacks as did “the people of Beirut without difference of sect” (<em>ahl bayrūt ʿalā ikhtilāf madhāhibihim</em>), who draw up a petition to the public prosecutor of Beirut to forward the case to the courts and commence prosecuting the perpetrators.<a href="#fn184" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a></p>
<p>Amidst this quarrel news emerged that <em>al-Iqbāl</em> in Beirut was seemingly persecuted by the municipality, whereas <em>al-Muqtabas</em> in Damascus was prosecuted for an allegedly treacherous article on the caliphate published on 1 September,<a href="#fn185" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a> in the consequence of which the paper was suspended on 20 September and its publisher Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī was to be put on trial. The investigation was held in absentia as Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī had been tipped off and again managed to flee; this time to Paris, where he wrote 35 long articles later published as “The Oddities of the West” (<em>gharāʾib al-gharb</em>). The investigation that eventually cleared him from all charges took four months and he subsequently returned to Damascus.<a href="#fn186" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a></p>
<p>By that time, in early 1910, his brother Aḥmad Kurd ʿAlī had already obtained a permit for a substitute daily newspaper and commenced publication under the title of <em>al-Umma</em> (The Nation).<a href="#fn187" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> They changed the title back to <em>al-Muqtabas</em> on 9 March 1910 and opened with an editorial that heralded the constitution which was aptly titled “The Freedom of Press”.<a href="#fn188" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="onwards-times-of-crisis">1912 onwards: times of crisis</h3>
<p>Censorship and prosecution of publishers intensified in 1911/12.<a href="#fn189" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> The euphoria over the new constitutional rule had quickly vanished as the empire faced external and internal crisis. Externally the empire fought over possession of and ultimately lost core European provinces as well as North African provinces: Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908; Greece intervened in Crete in 1910; the empire went to war over Italy’s occupation of Tripoli in Libya and the Cyrenaica in 1911/12 and against Montenegro, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece over Macedonia in the Balkan War(s) of 1912/13, in the process of which Albania seceded from the empire. Internally, the {&gt;&gt;Young Turk “Committee of Union and Progress” (<em>ittiḥād ve teraḳḳī cemiyeti</em>, henceforth &lt;&lt;}CUP{&gt;&gt;)&lt;&lt;} lost power to the opposition party of the “Freedom and Accord Party” (<em>ḥürriyet ve itiʾlāf fırḳası</em>, also known as Liberal Entente) despite two snap general elections of February and April 1912. In January 1913, when the Great Powers suggested the liberal Ottoman government should cede the old capital city of Edirne to Bulgaria, the CUP staged a successful coup d’état led by Enver Bey, Talaat Bey, and Cemal Bey that established CUP-monopoly of power for the final years of the empire.</p>
<p>On 18 March 1912, <em>Taḳvīm-i Vaḳāyiʿ</em> published amendments to article 2 and a supplement to the Law on Printed Material of 1909 that came into effect with their publication. Recognising their importance, <em>al-Muqtabas</em> provided Arabic translations. The amendment to article 2 which applied to all existing and future publications, severely limited the circle of persons eligible to be “responsible editors” for any newspaper: henceforth they had to be male Ottoman subjects{&gt;&gt; (<em>tebaʿa</em>)&lt;&lt;} of 21 years of age, and graduates of an <em>iʿdādī</em> secondary school. In addition, they had to have an unblemished criminal record and moral standing. Concessionaires of provincial newspapers had to provide a security of deposit of £T 100 and of £T 50 for political periodicals{&gt;&gt; £T 500 and £T 200 in the capital&lt;&lt;}. The formally temporary supplement to the law prohibited the publication of articles or leaflets authored by serving, retired or prospective officers, gendarmes, and health officials in the armed forces ventilating their thoughts on domestic or foreign politics or any criticism of the military government. Responsible editors transgressing this law were punishable by imprisonment of one week to six months and a pecuniary penalty of £T 5 to £T 20.<a href="#fn190" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a></p>
<p>At about the same time, in mid-March 1912, the newspapers in Beirut were made to provide copies of every issue to the secular court (<em>al-dīwān al-ʿurfī</em>) within an hour of printing with a reference to article 8 of the same Law on Printed Material. As <em>al-Muqtabas</em> diligently pointed out, this reference was erroneous since the law only stated the copies must be supplied to the public prosecutors at the centre of the kaza and the province.<a href="#fn191" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a>Only one month later, <em>al-Muqtabas</em> was banned from publication and an attempt was made to arrest Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī over the re-print of a <em>qaṣīda</em> by Shaykh Ibrāhīm al-Uskūbī that had been previously published in the two Beiruti papers of <em>al-Waṭan</em> and <em>al-Balagh</em> without any repercussion{&gt;&gt; wording&lt;&lt;} from the censors. However, Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī was seemingly warned by the arrest party itself and managed to escape to Egypt; his brother Aḥmad was arrested in his stead. While at large, Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī was accused of having formed a secret society with the purpose of overthrowing the Caliphate and charged with high treason, while the authorities in Beirut suspended <em>al-Balagh</em> from publication.<a href="#fn192" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a></p>
<p>{&gt;&gt;In September 1912/ Ramadan 1330 the authorities attempted to exile Faḥmī Efendi Ghazī, the publisher and responsible editor of the satirical magazine <em>Baradā</em>; {BoaBeo4082306107Şamda 1912}{Devey 1912g}&lt;&lt;}</p>
<p><em>Al-Muqtabas</em> resumed publication on 8 August after {&gt;&gt;Ḥusayn &lt;&lt;}Nāẓim Pasha—to whose personal enmity the persecution of <em>al-Muqtabas</em> and its publisher was attributed by the latter and his contemporaries—<a href="#fn193" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a>had been removed from the governorship of Syria in mid-June.<a href="#fn194" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a> Publication of <em>al-Muqtabas</em> continued despite its outspoken critique of the “Unionists” (<em>al-ittiḥādiyūn</em>)<a href="#fn195" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> until renewed conflicts with the authorities in September 1913 necessitated the shift to yet another title: Between September 1913 and January 1914, the newspaper was published as <em>al-Qabas</em> (The Firebrand) by the former MP and ardent critic of the Committee of Union and Progress Shukrī al-ʿAsalī and Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī.<a href="#fn196" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> Nevertheless, Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī won the support of Cemal Pasha, member of the ruling triumvirate and commander of the 4th Army in Damascus, locally known as <em>al-saffāḥ</em> (the butcher) during World War I. In consequence, <em>al-Muqtabas</em> was not suspended until 1917 and, unlike its frequent contributor Shukrī al-ʿAsalī, Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī did not share the fate of many of his fellow journalists among the “martyrs”, who were publicly executed in Beirut and Damascus in 1915 and 1916.<a href="#fn197" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a></p>
<p>Other papers followed tactics of transformation similar to <em>al-Muqtabas</em>’:<a href="#fn198" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a> Whenever one iteration was banned from publication, they re-appeared under a new and slightly different title. Thus, ʿAbd al-Ghanī al-ʿUraysī’s daily{&gt;&gt; ?&lt;&lt;} <em>al-Mufīd</em>, published in Beirut since February 1909, was banned in May 1912 and re-appeared as <em>Ṣadā al-Mufīd</em> only a few days later. In September <em>Ṣadā al-Mufīd</em> was also suspended and resumed publication as <em>Lisān al-ʿArab</em>, which was succeeded by <em>al-Fatā al-ʿArab</em> within five days of publication. The later was banned in November 1913, but ʿAbd al-Ghanī al-ʿUraysī acquired the permit for resuming publication by December. This final iteration was ultimately banned from publication in July 1914.<a href="#fn199" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a> Tellingly, Rashīd Ridā’s <em>al-Manār</em> reported this as the suspension of <em>al-Mufīd</em>.<a href="#fn200" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a> ʿAbd al-Ghanī al-ʿUraysī was executed on 6 May 1916 in Beirut.<a href="#fn201" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="sec-censorship">1.2 The realities of censorship</h1>
<p>Returning to the original question to which extent my sources are biased and gendered by official censorship and an internalised <em>habitus</em> of their publishers and editors, I will provide a short overview of the traceable reality of censorship in Ottoman Lebanon, based on Cioeta’s groundbreaking study and my own research. Cioeta provided a table of warnings, suspensions, and bans of periodicals published by <em>Thamarāt al-Funūn</em> and <em>al-Iqbāl</em>, which I was able to substantially augment{&gt;&gt; wording?&lt;&lt;} with data from other Beiruti and Damascene newspapers (see Table 1.2). Most importantly, I was able to check collections of some of these newspapers for actual gaps in publication dates corresponding to issued suspensions.<a href="#fn202" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> {&gt;&gt;Do we have some findings to present?&lt;&lt;}</p>
<p>The main question is to which extent were legal provisions applied? Who applied them? What were the reasons cited by warnings and suspensions? What was reported on and, probably more revealing, what was not reported on? When were newspapers ripe with articles criticizing the state and its officials and when did they resort to eulogy? And finally, can we establish a chronology of an ever-expanding state and its capabilities of surveillance?</p>
<h2 id="number-and-distribution-of-warnings-suspensions-etc.">Number and distribution of warnings, suspensions etc.</h2>
<p>There is compelling evidence that in Beirut <em>a posteriori</em> censorship, as designed by the 1864 Law on Printed Material, was only implemented from the Ottoman-Russian War of 1877–78 and the subsequent abolition of constitutional freedoms onwards.<a href="#fn203" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a> Only a further ten years later, Syrian emigrants to Egypt, such as Jurjī Zaydān and Salīm Sarkīs began citing oppressive censorship within the Ottoman Empire as a reason for their relocation.<a href="#fn204" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a></p>
<p>Warnings and suspensions were signed by Khalīl Efendi al-Khūrī in his function as “Director of Foreign Affairs and Printed Materials” (<em>mudīr al-umūr al-ajnabiyya wa-l-maṭbūʿāt</em>)<a href="#fn205" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a> and, during his absence{&gt;&gt; in 1887&lt;&lt;}, by his deputy Yūsuf Ṭanūs Efendi until 1888.<a href="#fn206" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a> In July 1887, the latter issued a warning (<em>ikhṭār</em>) to all publishers in Beirut that Egyptian news were not to be published unless they were authorised by the administration of foreign affairs and printed materials.<a href="#fn207" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a> However, already during the 1880s various warnings had been issued by the <em>mutaṣarrif</em> of Beirut.<a href="#fn208" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a> After the separation of the province of Beirut from Syria, newspaper editors in Beirut were summoned to the Serail in August 1889, where the <em>mektupçu</em> of the province Ḥasan Fāʾiz Efendi al-Jābī informed them about their patriotic duties and the resulting regime of censorship. Henceforth, they were to submit a copy of every story prior to publication to him and Mishāl Efendi Addah (Michel Edde)<a href="#fn209" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a> for approval. After the third warning, any paper was to be banned from publication in compliance with the Law on Printed Material.<a href="#fn210" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a> {&gt;&gt;This would refer to the 1864 legislation.

<p>We have almost no information on the system of censorship in Damascus. Obviously, the official gazette <em>Sūriye</em>’s content was published with official approval. Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī, himself employed as a coworker of Khalīl Efendi al-Khūrī at the administration of foreign affairs in Damascus, submitted every copy of an article to the paper’s proprietor Muṣṭafā Wāṣif Efendi for self-censorship during his time as editor-in-chief at the semi-official <em>al-Shām</em> between 1897 and 1900. In his memoirs he lamented the absolute unpredictability of Muṣṭafā Wāṣif Efendi’s judgement, who would even reject Arabic translations of articles form newspapers in the capital.<a href="#fn215" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a> Nevertheless, this overtly cautious approach did not protect <em>al-Shām</em> from prosecution. Despite being published by the director of the provincial printing press, the paper was banned from publication for four months between October 1902 and February 1903.<a href="#fn216" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a></p>
<p>Total numbers of warnings (<em>ikhṭār</em>) and suspensions (<em>taʿṭīl</em>) between 1878 and 1914 are almost equal at about 70. Both are rather unevenly distributed throughout the forty years under study. Warnings are heavily clustered with peaks of up to eight warnings per annum in the early 1880s (particularly 1884), in 1894, and between 1898 and 1901 (Table 1.3.1). Suspensions are more evenly distributed, but significant clusters can still be identified and match the distribution of warnings: the early 1880s, 1895, and 1901–04 (Table 1.4.1). The peak in 1894/95 correlates with the new Law on Printing Presses. Before 1894—or possibly 1888{&gt;&gt; Grallert Till, 17.06.15 20:38: what does that mean?&lt;&lt;}—as indicated by the summoning of Beirut’s publishers before the <em>mektupçu</em> in 1889, legal prescriptions did not require publishers to submit copies of their newspapers to the censoring authorities prior to publication. The ever increasing number of interventions by the censors during the early twentieth century demonstrates a general expansion of bureaucratic capabilities and its bid to dominance.</p>
<p>If aggregated by month, some clustering of warnings occurs in April and September as well as the <em>hijrī</em> month of Shawwāl (Tables 1.3.2 and 1.3.3). This however, is remedied if compounded with the suspensions, which were most frequent in January as well as the <em>hijrī</em> months of Shaʿbān and Ramaḍān (Tables 1.4.2 and 1.4.3). Thus, the tentative supposition that censorship was tightened around important imperial events, such as the accession of ʿAbdülḥāmid II to the throne on 18 Aghusṭūs <em>mālī</em> or his birthday on 16 Shaʿbān <em>hijrī</em>, is not supported by the data.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-of-suspensions">Implementation of suspensions</h2>
<p>Many of the officially issued suspensions were followed by a corresponding gap in publication, which means in turn that not every suspension was actually implemented, even after 1900 (Table 1.2).<a href="#fn217" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a> However, not every gap in publication could be translated into interferences of the authorities: <em>al-Janna</em>, for instance, had to forego publication for two months while waiting for the approval of its re-application for permit after the death of its publisher, Salīm al-Bustānī in September 1884.<a href="#fn218" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a> In another instance, the <em>Adabiyya</em> press of Khalīl Sarkīs burnt down in September 1895, causing a suspension of <em>Lisān al-Ḥāl</em> for one month<a href="#fn219" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a>, while the two months gap in the publication of <em>Thamarāt al-Funūn</em> in summer 1892 went entirely uncommented on.<a href="#fn220" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reasons-for-warnings-and-suspensions">Reasons for warnings and suspensions</h2>
<p>The most common reasons cited for both warnings and suspensions is having ignored the censor’s warning, followed by publication of false news, non-compliance with the press code, and disturbing public tranquillity and causing anxieties (<em>takhdīsh al-adhhān</em>).<a href="#fn221" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a> While during the 1880s the publication of false news or generally news from Egypt were the most frequently quoted reasons, warnings to henceforth comply with the censors’ decisions were first mentioned in 1889. During the early 1900s until 1908, newspapers were primarily reprimanded and banned over violations of the basic principles (<em>uṣūl</em>) of the press laws or of censorship itself (<em>uṣūl al-murāqaba</em>). Clearly, at least in Beirut, publishers were willing to challenge the censoring authorities.</p>
<p>As Cioeta already noted, the warnings did not refer to specifically banned words or topics beyond the generic vagueness provided by the relevant laws. Neither articles mentioning “nose” nor “republic” were automatically banned from publication, even tough lists of formerly banned words, published after the restoration of the constitution in 1908, did mention them.<a href="#fn222" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref222"><sup>222</sup></a> Despite Salīm Sarkīs’ claims to the contrary, raised in his famous polemic against the <em>mektupçu</em>(s) of Beirut from Cairo in 1896, <em>jumhūr</em> was the most common term to denote gatherings of people until the mid-1890s.<a href="#fn223" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref223"><sup>223</sup></a> Yet, it must be borne in mind that Sarkīs, for the largest part, provided specific and sometimes datable anecdotes to illustrate his claim of stupendous and arbitrary censorship. Although his book is compiled as a series of entries headed with specific terms, he does not explicitly claim that the use of these words was absolutely prohibited.<a href="#fn224" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref224"><sup>224</sup></a></p>
<p>What transpires from the various accounts of journalists, such as Salīm Sarkīs, Jurjī Zaydān, or Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī—either written after they left <em>Bilād al-Shām</em> or after the end of the Ottoman Empire—is a sense of volatility and insecurity at the behest of censors and, not less important, self-censoring publishers. One could never be sure which articles were to be deleted and which would make it through. Much to our astonishment, Nawfal Efendi Niʿmat Allah Nawfal’s Arabic translation of the Ottoman constitution was published by the <em>Adabiyya</em> press of Khalīl Sarkīs, the publisher of <em>Lisān al-Ḥāl</em>, in Beirut under the editorship of Khalīl Efendi Khūrī, the censor himself, in 1883 or 1887<a href="#fn225" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref225"><sup>225</sup></a>—and advertisements for this edition can be found until 1894.<a href="#fn226" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a> In 1892, the provincial yearbook for Syria printed the Ottoman original, including the <em>ḫaṭṭ-i hümāyūn</em> to Midḥat Pasha, the mentioning of whose name was prosecuted by the censor just a few years before.<a href="#fn227" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref227"><sup>227</sup></a> An Arabic translation of the 1856 reform edict was published in <em>al-Bashīr</em> in November 1895.<a href="#fn228" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref228"><sup>228</sup></a> That is, despite the constitution, and with it freedom of press, having been abolished years before, literate elites and bureaucrats in Syria could read about these very liberties in printed form and with official approval. On Monday, 27 July 1908, the day news of the restoration of the constitution broke in Beirut, the Beiruti newspaper <em>al-Iqbāl</em> noted that the it would not print any articles of the constitution, as the text was readily available from book stores and publishing presses in the city and as it had been reprinted in legal compendia and various imperial <em>Sālnāme</em>s.<a href="#fn229" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref229"><sup>229</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="permissible-content">permissible content</h2>
<p>Despite the increasing surveillance of the censors, newspapers in Beirut and Damascus were surprisingly outspoken in their criticism of officials and their conduct in office without provoking interference from the authorities. Within the sample of news reports from Damascus, we find hundreds of articles openly criticising specific administrative units{&gt;&gt; 246&lt;&lt;} (Table 1.5.1). Most prominent among them was the municipality, which was criticised for neglecting its duties to secure fair prices,<a href="#fn230" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref230"><sup>230</sup></a> to mend the roads,<a href="#fn231" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref231"><sup>231</sup></a> to provide street cleaning services,<a href="#fn232" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref232"><sup>232</sup></a> or to keep the city lit at night.<a href="#fn233" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref233"><sup>233</sup></a> Open criticism of individual officials was comparatively rare{&gt;&gt; 34&lt;&lt;} (Table 1.5.2) and usually published only after the person in question had fallen from favour, when it could be combined with the praise of superior officials and the prosecuting authorities.<a href="#fn234" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref234"><sup>234</sup></a> In line with other indicators of increasing censorship after the early 1890s, critical reports on the authorities disappear almost completely from our sample until the mid-1900s (only 16 articles between 1893–1903). The censors’ warnings never explicitly mentioned criticism of the ruling authorities as punishable offence, but excessive criticism would have certainly be deemed as threatening public order and tranquility. After the restoration of the constitution, the number of critical articles explodes, with the effect that more than 40 per cent of all critical articles were published between 1908 and 1914. The same pattern can be observed for articles criticising private individuals or institutions outside the realm of the state.</p>
<p>It is important to note that criticism of administrative bodies and individual officials in Damascus was not limited to the private press of Beirut. The official gazette <em>Sūriye</em> as well as the semi-private <em>al-Shām</em> frequently tried to influence “the public” and to exercise political pressure on the municipality through criticism of its negligence of repairs and street cleaning.<a href="#fn235" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a> Hence, despite criticism being less frequent than ten years earlier, one could read in 1900 that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the municipality decided to clean the [covered] section of the Barada between the bridge in front of the police headquarters [i.e. Marja Square] to the channels of the citadel from rubbish and to disinfect everything etc. However, until today not a single worker has been seen on any part of the river bed, which is most likely due to the lack of skilled workers. Equally, municipal inspectors and bailiffs (<em>jāwīsh</em>) do not do their job. We ask the municipality to do something [about this deplorable state of affairs].”<a href="#fn236" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref236"><sup>236</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Praise for the authorities beyond the obligatory eulogies of the Sultan and his rule on the occasion of various public rituals, such as ʿAbdülḥamīd II’s birthday on 16 Shaʿbān <em>hijrī</em> or the anniversary of his accession to the throne on 18 Aghusṭūs <em>mālī</em>, the departure of the Ḥajj caravan to Mecca in early Shawwāl <em>hijrī</em> or the arrival of new governors, was much less common than critical articles.<a href="#fn237" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a> The distribution of such praise somewhat complements the distribution of critical articles during the late 1870s and early 1880s (Table 1.6.1). But otherwise, praise, just like criticism, ceased to be published between the early 1890s and the early 1900s and peaks during the first year after the restoration of the constitution. In other words, during the first decade after the promulgation of the new Law on Printing Presses in 1894, news reports avoided to express any discernible opinion on the reported events.</p>
<p>Praise for individual officials was slightly more common than praise for the authorities in general and largely reserved for the leading officials of the province, namely the governor (Table 1.6.2). Contrasting with its outspoken criticism of the municipality, the official gazette <em>Sūriye</em> abounded with praise for the governor, and is the almost exclusive source of positive acclaim within my sample during the years, for which we have surviving collections.<a href="#fn238" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a></p>
<p>{&gt;&gt;Quite a substantial number of articles offering praise to either the authorities or individual officials or both were replies to earlier more critical articles, some of which had been published in foreign newspapers; e.g.{lisan 583} replied to a paper in Alexandria that Damascus was as quite and peaceful as Paris. {lisan 646a} praised the efforts of the new third <em>baladiyya</em> in reply to earlier criticism.&lt;&lt;}</p>
<h2 id="events-not-reported-on">Events not reported on</h2>
<p>Equally important to the distribution of criticism and praise for the general impression on the extent of permissible content, are the events not reported on by the press, namely such incidents, the explicit publication of which would have embarrassed the authorities at large. The most prominent example is the conflagration of the Umayyad Mosque during roofing works in October 1893. For the next nine years, newspapers were rife with reports on rebuilding efforts and provided detailed accounts of rich Damascenes’ financial contributions to the <em>iʿāne</em> funding the restoration.<a href="#fn239" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref239"><sup>239</sup></a> The cause for all these efforts, however, was never mentioned.<a href="#fn240" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref240"><sup>240</sup></a> In a similar wake after 1908, one reader, who tellingly signed “a free Ottoman”{&gt;&gt; [this could be Salīm Sarkīs, who used this pseudonym earlier]&lt;&lt;}, wrote a reply to reports from Damascus in which he accused both the official gazette <em>Sūriye</em> and the correspondent of <em>Thamarāt al-Funūn</em> of straight-forwardly mending the truth. He argued that despite the two—and various other papers—having reported the successful completion of the ʿAyn Fīja water works with water being supplied to the Serail in Damascus, works were indeed far from complete.<a href="#fn241" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref241"><sup>241</sup></a></p>
<p>The other pertinent case were reports on physical violence. Newspapers reported extensively on violence, but they did so within the overarching discourse on violence—both as physical act and the report thereon—as indicator of failing state authority. Within this discourse, three types of violence and respective socio-linguistic strategies can be distinguished, which all legitimise the use of force against the perpetrators. As instances of failing authority, violent incidents were generally not covered in detail and authors focused on the (re-)actions of the authorities. Furthermore there existed a positive correlation between the distance—be it socially or geographically—of the violent action from the authorities and the frequency and details of the reports: The further away, the more reports can be found (on Haifa, Aleppo, the Ḥawrān, Hijāz, Yemen, etc.).{&gt;&gt; Grallert Till, 05.12.12 14:05: move&lt;&lt;} The three types of violence as observable in the news reports mirror the three types of felonies as provided by the first article of the Ottoman Penal Code of 1858: crimes against the individual person (<em>bir şaḫṣ</em>), against public order (<em>āsāyış-i ʿumūmī</em>), and against the state (<em>devlet</em>).<a href="#fn242" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref242"><sup>242</sup></a> {&gt;&gt;on <em>āsāyış</em> see also {Reinkowski 2005a@233}; on the translation as <em>rāḥa</em> see above&lt;&lt;}</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Outright criminal violence against persons and property, which is dealt with according to the laws (state, religious, and customary law). Any such incidence could be turned into an affirmative incident, as long as state agents were portrayed as acting firmly and quickly to restore order and tranquility. Thus, newspapers were rife with reports on burglaries, theft, and murder, and many incorporated sections labelled <em>min jūrnāl al-būlīs</em> or <em>waqāʾiʿ al-ḍābitā</em> that provided police reports at some point.<a href="#fn243" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref243"><sup>243</sup></a></li>
<li>Inter-communal violence. Reports on any such events were much less common than those on crime proper and were potentially more challenging to the prevailing order. Yet, if such violence was short-lived or if it was indeed subdued by state agents, coverage of these incidents could provide legitimacy for the pacifying and mediating state. This most certainly was the case in the violent battles between youths of the Greek Catholic community in Bāb Tūmā and the Greek Orthodox community of the Mīdān on occasion of a burial on a disputed graveyard in 1878<a href="#fn244" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref244"><sup>244</sup></a> or the clashes between Muslims from Qaymariyya and ʿAmāra and Christians from Bāb Tūmā in 1884.<a href="#fn245" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref245"><sup>245</sup></a> However, over the course of the following decades reports cease to be published even when the authorities took an active role in containing the violence, such as during the blood libel of Easter / Passover 1890,<a href="#fn246" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref246"><sup>246</sup></a> which was probably due to regulations prohibiting the publication of any news that could instigate religious strife or stir the minds of the people (<em>takhdīsh adhhān al-ahālī</em>).</li>
<li>Outright rebellions against the state and state agents (including mutinying officials and soldiers). As we will see in the final chapters of this thesis, such incidents were rather rare and reports on them even less frequent. Usually the events reported on occurred on the geographic and ethno-religious margins or outside the province. The focus is on the response of the authorities. Reports on slaughtered villagers provide the legitimacy for calling out conscripts and despatching them to the scene of the violence in response. Thus, one is confronted with hundreds of reports on rebellious bandits (<em>ashqiyā</em>) among the Druze, the Bedouins, and the Circassian refugees (to a much lesser degree this is true for the Kurds) of the Ḥawrān, the Lajā, and the deserts to the East. In absence of any reports to the contrary, the city of Damascus emerged as the peaceful seat of the {&gt;&gt; legitimate&lt;&lt;}authorities.</li>
