    + add data from project jarāʾid

        * final date of publicaion: done
            - necessity to format dates from yyyy to yyyy-01-01 before import to R
            - since there are sometimes more than one final date, each one should generate a new row in the data table

        * permits: done until spring 1909
        * censorship: done
